This is a repository you can use to start your HTML/CSS/JavaScript project.

I have included: index.html, styles.css, main.js, and bs.bat - the batch file that will start browser-sync automatically

Make sure you edit index.html first and add your name in the author meta field. Then commit and push to make sure it's working for you.
